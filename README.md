# Single Directory Components Development
## Drupal Camp Costa Rica 2026

This project provides some starter options, all bundled together, to showcase how one could start working
with Single Directory Components in Drupal.

The themes provide different alternatives for doing this and then the shared components live on their own
repositories outside this project.

## Requirements

While this is at its base a regular Drupal site, having DDev for local development will make things easier.

If that's not the case, you need to setup:

* PHP 8.4+
* A web server (Apache, Nginx) that can serve PHP requests.
* A database server (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Getting started

Setup on a web server or run `ddev start` (local development).

### First time setup

After DDev has started, you might need to run `ddev composer install` to get all dependencies. Then access the site
on the browser and run the installation steps.

@TODO: Add here the information regarding the different themes and overview of how they work.
